- 👋 Hi, I’m @RachaelUni
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and software engineering. I've set this up for my university assignments.
- 🌱 I’m studying for a Master of Information Technology (Computer Science). 
- 💞️ I don't have too much extra time to collaborate on anything, to be honest, because my master's degree is taking up most of my waking hours and it's keeping me awake at night, usually the thought GPA...GPA...GPA is on a continuous loop. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... you'll never catch me. Oh fine, my username is rackle8733 on Discord. 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her, but don't care if you get them wrong. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I have literally no fun facts about me... I'm as boring as oats cooked in water.
